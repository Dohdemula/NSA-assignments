The TCP/IP model and the OSI reference model are important for understanding computer network communication, but they differ in their structure and usefulness.

The seven-layer OSI model categorises network communication into separate layers which are: physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers. Each layer performs specific tasks and connects with lower layers using standardised interfaces and protocols. It serves as a useful reference model since its modular design enables a thorough logical grasp of network communication. Though in reality, the OSI model isn't always strictly followed .

On the other hand, the TCP/IP model is a more simplified four-layered model that is specifically made for operation on the Internet. It includes: the transport layer, application layer, internet, and network interface layers. The TCP/IP model is much more appropriate as a framework for modern internet communication since it closely mimics the operational requirements of networking in the real world. In reality, the TCP/IP model's network interface and internet levels frequently perform tasks that the OSI model's physical, data link, and network layers perform. The OSI presentation and application layers are combined in the application layer, while the transport layer closely resembles the OSI transport layer.

The OSI model focuses on the theoretical and general application, which is one of the key differences between these models. Giving a point of reference for understanding networking concepts and protocols. The TCP/IP model,  represents a more practical, real-world approach that is closely matched with the operational requirements of the Internet.

In conclusion, the TCP/IP model offers a more streamlined and practical approach, specifically designed for the requirements of internet-based networking, whereas the OSI model offers a comprehensive and modular view of network communication. It is important to note that the TCP/IP paradigm, which strongly matches the internet's architecture, is the dominant foundation for designing and running modern computer networks.
